ANN - Artificial Neural Networks in C# (.NET Core)
======================================

C# implementations of various Neural Networks. 

* SelfOrganizingMap -> simple implementation of Self-Organizing Maps also known as Kohonen's maps.
* Backpropagation -> backpropagation training based neural network.

Check out ann.TestApp for few examples on how networks can be used.
